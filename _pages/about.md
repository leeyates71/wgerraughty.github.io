# About Me

### Who Am I?
My name is William Gerraughty, and I am in my last two terms at SNHU for my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I have been in this program for a little over two years having transferred to SNHU and the online program after my freshman year. During the course of the program, I’ve learned to use different languages across a variety of topics, including databases, client/server development, and embedded systems programming. I also volunteer as a foster for Big Fluffy Dog Rescue. Currently, I am just beginning my career entering employment in the IT department of my local hospital.

### My Career
Having interned with the department over the summer, I was able to witness firsthand how a hospital, especially one as large as mine, uses computer science skills to continually improve care for patients, accessibility for employees, and maintain a secure system. Working with the IT department during the internship also helped show just how many different areas of work there are even in the same organization, with the hospital having several in-house teams of different specializations. For now, I plan to build up as many technical skills and whatever knowledge as I can in my new position. With so many areas to choose to go into, I am having a hard time coming up with any one single area to specialize in for future career plans.
